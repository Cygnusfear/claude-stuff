Mark each element, function, detail of this plan with 2 labels:
- The appropriate RFC requirement level for a best practice implementation according to RFC 2119 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119)
- The distance to the original proposed scope, implementation wise:
  - CORE REQUIREMENT
  - IMPLICIT REQUIREMENT
  - INTERPRETED
  - TANGENTIAL
  - OVERSCOPED
- Especially look into DETAILS of the execution- what sort of parts of the plan are badly thought out? dubious checks, makeshift solutions, things that would completely fall over in a real scenario.

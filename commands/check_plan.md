I want you to do a full audit of changes and compare them to the plan, then I want a task list of tasks that still need to be done

The approach to this works as follows -> USE A TASK TO COMPLETE THE FOLLOWING -> :
1. you check ALL the filenames and you make a comprehensive todo list of each filenames
2. you create a looping task with X interations (amount of ALL files)
- you create a task for yourself to check each file and think hard about it
- check your memory on each file for context
- DO NOT EDIT THE FILE
- you critically assess if you've fully audited the file
- you can then mark the file either done or not done
- you then store in your memory your assessment of the file- PLUS an updated todo list minus the file you've just checked if it's done
3. you repeat this process until you've checked all the files

Then run a full typecheck and full lint.
